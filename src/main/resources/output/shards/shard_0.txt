A distributed system is a model in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages
The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal
Each component has its own local memory and processes its own information
The distributed system as a whole appears to users as a single coherent system
Key Characteristics of distributed systems include
Scalability The ability to handle growth in users and workloads
Fault Tolerance The capability to continue operating in the event of a failure of some components
Concurrency The ability to execute multiple computations simultaneously
Transparency The system hides the complexity and details of the distribution from users
There are several types of transparency in distributed systems
Location Transparency Users do not need to know where resources are located
Migration Transparency Resources can move without affecting the user
Replication Transparency Users are unaware of the number of copies of resources
