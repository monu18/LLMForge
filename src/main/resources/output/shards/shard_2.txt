MessageOriented Middleware MOM Facilitates messaging between distributed components
Object Middleware Allows objects to communicate across networks
Distributed systems can be vulnerable to various issues
Network Latency Delay in communication due to the network
Partial Failures Some components may fail while others continue to operate
Data Consistency Maintaining a consistent view of data across distributed nodes
To address data consistency distributed systems often employ
Replication Maintaining copies of data on multiple nodes
Consistency Models define how changes to data are visible to different nodes
Examples of consistency models include
Strong Consistency Guarantees that all accesses return the most recent write
Eventual Consistency Guarantees that given enough time all copies will converge
Causal Consistency Ensures that operations that are causally related are seen by all nodes in the same order
